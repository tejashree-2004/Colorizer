## Overview
MLC-LLM is a system for running and deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently across different platforms. It enables applications to perform real-time LLM inference locally or on servers without relying entirely on external cloud APIs.

The project focuses on optimizing model execution, managing inference pipelines, and exposing LLMs through APIs for integration into real-world applications.

---

## Motivation
Large language models are now a core component of modern software systems. However, deploying them efficiently, reliably, and at scale is a major engineering challenge.

This project was explored to understand:
- How LLMs can be compiled and optimized for different hardware
- How inference pipelines are built
- How AI models are served inside production applications

---

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Model compilation and runtime engines  
- REST and programmatic APIs  

---

## Features
- High-performance LLM inference  
- Model compilation and runtime optimization  
- API-based access to language models  
- Support for multiple deployment environments  
- Integration-ready for real applications  

---

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejashree-2004/mlc-llm.git
cd mlc-llm
# Follow platform-specific installation instructions

**## Usage**
Run an LLM model locally:

```bash
python run_model.py

POST /generate
{
  "prompt": "Explain cloud computing"
}

Example Output

The system returns natural language responses generated by the deployed large language model in real time, such as explanations, summaries, or conversational replies based on the input prompt.
